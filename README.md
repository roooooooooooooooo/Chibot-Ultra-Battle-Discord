# Chibot-Ultra-Battle-Discord
CHuB for Discord

(in progress)


1) create a ".env" file in the root directory with only this line:
DISCORD_API_TOKEN = [your discord bot's token]

2) open settings.json and set the discord_channel_id to the, you know, discord channel id of the channel where you want the bot to send messages.

3) Run chub2k23.exe. If it fails to run, rightclick, hit properties, set compatibility mode to Windows XP Service Pack 3
