'INFO:
'This modlue should be able to be used in any vb 4,5,6 app
'you may choose to use it in, just if possible, give me a
'little credit in you finised app!
'This file contains most of the Uematsu.dll api calls
'which are described in 'Uematsu.html' which can be found
'with the current release of 'Super Jukebox'.
'I have written some subs to make using Uematsu.dll easyer:
'
' DoPlay (Fname as String)
'   Plays the SPC specified in Fname, eg.
'   spctoplay = "c:\spcs\finfan3.spc"
'   DoPlay (spctoplay) Or DoPlay("c:\spcs\finfan3.spc")
'   Notes:
'   If called while a spc is playing it will restart the SPC,
'   If called while a spc is SPCPaused it will resume playback.
'
' DoPause
'   Pauses / Unpauses currenly playing spc
'
' DoStop
'   Stops the currently playing spc
'   Note: Allways call this when you shut you app down
'           (if possible, avoid using ENDs).
'
' Set_Config (cfg1 as Uematsu_CONFIG, cfg2 as Uematsu_Seperate_config)
'   Sets SNESAPU/Uematsu.dll's configuration.
'   Not 100% needed but is usefull if you want optimum
'   performance on a range of different specced PCs.
