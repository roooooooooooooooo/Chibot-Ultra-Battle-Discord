"Holy River"
"The Holy River runs down from the Central Mountains, southwest toward"
"Roid. As the river nears the sea, it quickly widens out and the water flows"
"along slowly and gracefully. Roid was built on the western"
"shore of the Holy River, just north of the Delta. The Port"
"of Roid is actually on the Holy River, and not the"
"Southern Sea. Ships going to Roid must travel past"
"the Great Delta Island and several kilometers up the"
"wide river to the port."
